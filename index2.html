                <img  class="amig" src="ar13.jpg" alt="">
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>The Knight, Giant, Musketeer and Mini P.E.K.K.A. are in every deck for a reason:<br>
                they are the best cards for Arena 1.<br> 
                Your performance will be very good if you use these cards in your deck well. <br>
                Even so, it is important to also have some spell cards <br>
                such as Arrows and Fireball for aerial support. <br>
                Don't forget to take advantage of cards with various units like Goblins and Archers.<br></p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2 class="gold">Arena 2: Pit of Bones</h2>
                <br>
                <h3>Deck 1</h3>
                <img  class="amig" src="ar21.jpg" alt="">
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>If you include the Valkyrie, Bomber and Baby Dragon cards, you will probably do well in Arena 2.<br>
                Make some variations on the cards and improve your deck according to your strategies.<br>
                Anyway, of the Arena 1 cards, it is recommended to focus on leveling<br>
                the Giant, Mini P.E.K.K.A. and Fireball.<br>
                Seriously, you won't regret it.</p><br>

                <h2 class="gold">Arena 3: Barbarian Tournament</h2>
                <br>
                <h3>Deck 1</h3>
                <img  class="amig" src="ar31.jpg" alt="">
                <br>
                <br>

                <img  class="amig" src="ar33.jpg" alt="">
                <p><br>
                For decks 1 and 2, it's good to improve Valkyrie, Baby Dragon and Mini P.E.K.K.A a lot.<br>
                Take a good look at your higher tier cards to choose the ideal deck.<br>
                With deck 3 it's the same thing, replacing the Giant with the Baby Dragon.<br>
                Generally, the best choice for Arena 3 is to use high-level cards<br>
                especially those mentioned above.<br>
                Overall, Skeleton Army is a very effective group unit card. <br>
                In Arena 3, this card serves to support other stronger cards <br>
                defending and preventing enemy units from advancing in your area. <br>
                Be sure to include this card in any of your decks!</p><br>

                <h2 class="gold">Arena 4: P.E.K.K.A Playground</h2>

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                When you reach Arena 4, it's time to use new cards like Barbarians, P.E.K.K.A. and the Mage.<br>
                The decks we suggest are new proposals and can do a lot of damage to rivals in this arena<br>
                as long as these cards have already been worked on before. <br>
                It is important that all the cards in your deck are at a good power level.<br>
                Therefore, in some cases, it may be worth continuing to use Arena 3 decks.</p><br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <h2 class="gold">Arena 5: Valley of Spells</h2>
                <br>
                <h3>Deck 1</h3>
                <img  class="amig" src="ar51.jpg" alt="">
                <br>
                <p><br>
                In Arena 5 you will unlock the Witch and the Corridor <br>
                key cards to continue advancing between Arenas.<br>
                To be used to their full efficiency <br>
                it is best to accompany them with the Fire Spirit, Skeleton Army and Servants.<br>
                In Arena 5 you can also obtain Zap <br>
                being a fundamental card even for the most advanced Arenas.<br>
                Don't forget to upload it!</p><br>

                <br>
                <h2 class="gold">Arena 6: Builder's Workshop</h2>
                <br>
                <h3>Deck 1</h3>
                <img  class="amig" src="ar61.jpg" alt="">
                <br>
                <br>

                <img  class="amig" src="ar63.jpg" alt="">
                <p><br>
                Be a little cautious in Arena 6. The cards you unlock in this Arena are strong <br>
                but you need to level them up several times beforehand.<br>
                Of all of them, the Balloon is one that can cause a lot of damage in good hands.<br> 
                The idea of ​​deck 1 (which includes Balloon) is to win by the number of units on the field. <br>
                Also use Barbarians, Archers, Skeleton Army and Tombstone to cause a high-quality offensive.<br>
                <br>
                Decks 2 and 3 are also good alternatives.<br>
                On the one hand, Corridor, Fire Spirit and Zap are very good cards.<br> 
                On the other hand, Valkyrie remains one of the essential cards for the first Clash Royale arenas.<br> 
                Always accompany other strong units. Both the Goblins and the Skeleton Army can give you good support.</p><br>

                <br>
                <p><br>The highlight of Arena 7 is the possibility of unlocking two very good cards: Megaknight and Prince.<br> 
                Don't be afraid to try different deck variations with these two main cards.<br> 
                From this Arena onwards, it is recommended that you continue improving some older cards<br>
                such as Valkyrie, Corridor and Witch.<br>
                Cards at high levels will be decisive between victory and defeat in advanced Arenas.

                When you arrive in this Arena, you will have unlocked dozens of different cards. <br>
                The possibilities are endless and your rivals will become more and more powerful! <br>
                The decks listed are balanced and perform well in most matches.<br>
                <br>    
                To use deck 1 effectively, you'll have to set the stage for Mega Knight. <br>
                Start with the Skeleton and Bat Army. <br>
                After accumulating some elixir, the ideal time has come to send more powerful units. <br>
                Deck 2 is similar, but with the Princess as the main card. <br>
                Finally, deck 3 is recommended for a defensive strategy. <br>
                Therefore, it is important to have the Ice Golem, Ice Spirit, Log and Cannon at high levels to battle.<br></p><br>
